# Unity Batch Raycasting

Optimizing Collision handling in Unity with Batch Raycasting! 

In this video, you'll learn how to efficiently manage projectile movement and collision detection using Unity's Job System and Burst Compiler. We'll use TransformAccessArray to optimize bullet movement and take advantage of parallel processing. You'll see how to split the workload across multiple threads, reduce performance bottlenecks, and ensure accurate collision detection using Raycasts. Whether you're building fast-paced action games or want to improve performance in complex simulations, this tutorial will show you practical steps to level up your game's efficiency.
